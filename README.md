Classical code attempts
=========

* my attempt at contributing code, not useful for legitamite useful but useful none the less.

main implementations are:

- factoring numbers (slow)
- prime number finding in a range
- least squares linear regression
- statisics data analysis (mean, median, standard deviation, upper/lower outlier)
- simple quadratic equation (plug in a,b,c)

=========

* The two ideas for these scripts was to have functions that help me with school 
work, that could be drastically simplified with a bit of tuned code.
* Also these python fucntions are meant to be pretty plain implementations to help anyone with simple tools.
