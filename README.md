Classical code attempts
=========

* my attempt at contributing code, not useful for legitamite useful but useful none the less.

main implementations are:

- factoring numbers
- linear regression
- statisics data analysis
- simple quadratic equation plugger

=========

* The two ideas for these scripts and functions was to help me with school 
work that could be drastically simplified with a bit of tuned code.
* Also these python fucntions are meant to be pretty plain implementations to help anyone with simple tools.
